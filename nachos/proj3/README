Code Description
________________

  We first implemented demand paging and lazy loading but first initializing all the virtual pages to 
  invalid, then creating handlePageFault() method. This method is called when the program hits an 
  invalid virtual page, and will load the corresponding page from either coff section (if the page
  does not have the used bit set and has a virtual page number within coff section), stack( if the 
  page is not used and is not within the coff section) or the swapfile
